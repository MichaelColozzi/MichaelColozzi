- My name is Michael Colozzi. I'm currently of juniro standing studying physics and mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder
- My interests include a whoel host of mathematical and physical puzzles. I love anytime I can come up with elegant solutions to problems. I take a special interest in both pure math as well as computational/numerical methods of solving problems. 
- My focus right now is math and physics. I hope to get a masters in physics by the end of my time in college through an accelerated master's program. After that I intend to go to grad school to pursue a PhD in mathematics. As of right now my primary interests in pure math are graph theory, group theory, and topology.
- I’m always looking for any research opportunities or interesting projects
